          Psychosynthesis provides a context within which both the impact of a person’s past and historical wounding can be held and worked with as well as their dreams and aspirations, and has become widely known as a psychology with a soul. </p>


					<p class="sectionText">It was originally conceived in 1910 by Italian psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, Robert Assagioli, a pioneer known for introducing an approach that integrated mindfulness and the spiritual dimension of the human experience into modern psychological theory and practice.</p>

			  	<p class="sectionText">He was a strong believer in the vast human potential for healing and change, enabling therapists to address growth on both the psychological and spiritual levels of the psyche. He consequently became an influential figure in the fields of Transpersonal and Humanistic psychology. His ideas are increasingly finding remarkable connections with data and research in neuroscience, adding greater validity to the ideas initiated over a hundred years ago.</p>

				Whilst Psychosynthesis does not involve any particular religious or spiritual teachings, it does give value and allow space for the more soulful dimensions of life to emerge. It places importance on our capacity to discover a sense of meaning and purpose in life, developing our innate drive to embrace and actualise the whole of who we are.
